Opensource Tool to quickly harden Linux Server

1) Lynis is a free and open source host-based auditing tool for unix like operating system 
that can be used to scan the entire systems installed and available software information, 
security information, user accounts without password, wrong file permissions, 
firewall auditing, etc. Lynis is one of the most powerful and useful tool for auditors, 
network and system administrators and penetration testers. You can easily test, scan and detect the 
vulnerability in linux-based systems using Lynis. Lynis does not harden your system automatically. 
But it will suggestions and security related warning to increase the security of the system. 
Lynis supports many Operating Systems, such as AIX, Ubuntu, Centos, FreeBSD, Debian, Fedora, 
Gentoo, kali, NetBSD, RHEL, OpenBSD, OpenSolaris, TrueOS and many more. 


You can audit MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Apache, Nginx, and NTP using Lynis. 
Lynis works by detecting operating system, search for available tools, check for Lynis update, 
then run tests from available plugins and reports the status of security scan.


2) Fail2ban - Fail2Ban is an intrusion prevention software framework that protects computer servers from brute-force attacks.
Written in the Python programming language, it is able to run on POSIX systems that have an interface to a packet-control 
system or firewall installed locally, for example, iptables or TCP Wrapper


3) ClamAV - Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) is a free software, cross-platform and open-source antivirus software toolkit able 
to detect many types of malicious software, including viruses. One of its main uses is on mail servers as a server-side email virus scanner. 
The application was developed for Unix and has third party versions available for AIX, BSD, HP-UX, Linux, macOS, OpenVMS, OSF (Tru64) and Solaris. 
As of version 0.97.5, ClamAV builds and runs on Microsoft Windows.[1][2] Both ClamAV and its updates are made available free of charge.

Sourcefire, a maker of intrusion detection products and the owner of Snort, announced on 17 August 2007 that it had acquired the trademarks 
and copyrights to ClamAV from five key developers.[3] Upon joining Sourcefire, the ClamAV team joined the Sourcefire Vulnerability Research Team (VRT). In turn, Sourcefire was acquired by Cisco in 2013.[4] The Sourcefire VRT became Cisco Talos,[5] and ClamAV development remains there.

4) Samba - Samba is a free software re-implementation of the SMB networking protocol, and was originally developed by Andrew Tridgell.
